# Video Game Analysis
This project explores global video game sales data from 1980â€“2020 to uncover trends in platform, genre, and regional performance. It was developed as part of my data science portfolio to showcase my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling.

## Questions Explored
- How have global video game sales changed over time?
- What are the top-selling platforms and games?
- Which genres are most successful, and how have their popularity changed?
- Are there noticeable differences in sales by region?
- Which platforms dominate in each genre?

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- Global sales peaked in 2008 and have since declined.
- The PS2 was the top-selling console.
- Action and Sports games dominated the market but declined after 2010.
- Wii Sports is the best-selling game with ~80M units sold.
- North America made up nearly 50% of global video game sales.

## Limitations
- Dataset ends in 2020 and lacks mobile/digital-only platforms.
- Limited regional detail and possible inconsistencies in game categorization.

## Next Steps
- Add post-2020 data, include digital/mobile sales.
- Use machine learning to forecast game or genre success.
- Correlate game ratings with commercial performance.
